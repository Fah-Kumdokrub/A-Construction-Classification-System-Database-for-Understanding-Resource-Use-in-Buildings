# A Construction Classification System Database for Understanding Resource Use in Building Construction

Welcome to the Construction Classification System Database for Understanding Resource Use in Buildings!

This is a database that contains data on the construction material quantities for buildings that are classified based on UniFormat and MasterFormat (CSI and CSC, 2010, 2016). The ontology developed for this database uses UniFormat in conjunction with MasterFormat for organizing and storing the building material data.

The initial database version is created by the research team supervised by Prof. Shoshanna Saxe at the University of Toronto and published in (Guven et al. 2021). The publication describes the dataset and the associated methods and details.

## Content

- Guidelines on contributing data are provided in `Guidelines.pdf`
- The database is described, and the meaning of variables are provided in `codebook.pdf` and `codebook.csv`.
- Tabular description of the variables in the database are provided in `codebook.csv`.
- The database is provided in `dataset.csv`.

## Contributing

We encourage use of the database and contributions and further extensions by users. Please refer to the guidelines and codebook for contributions to the database and using the data.
